# Stock-Analysis Challenge

## Overview of Project
This challenge aimed to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code to collect specific stock performance in 2017 and 2018. Given results will determine whether or not the stocks are worth investing in. The code was previously completed in a similar format; however, the objective of this refactor is to increase the efficiency of the original code.

## Results
Before adding the new portion of code to enhance the original code to perform the refactor, specific steps had to be completed;  creating an input box to enter the year, activating the correct worksheet, etc. These steps had to be precise to get the refactor to work appropriately. The code was written as follows.

## Summary

### Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code
Refactoring the code makes it more visually appealing and easy to read by utilizing the whitespace to create notes to follow through without getting lost. In addition, if the code is shared, the new user can quickly know what is being done at any given stage. This also helps with debugging and enhances programming. However, sometimes when we refactor, the code makes the application too large and can create an overflow error in the syntax, causing an additional risk of losing portions of the code.
